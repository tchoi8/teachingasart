# Teaching as Art
 
Offered at NYU ITP Spring 2017 

This class is for artists and creative practitioners who want to teach. A good teacher is also a great student themselves. They transform their curiosity into knowledge and share their learning process with others. One can learn to become a better teacher by staying fearless about ‘not knowing’ something, embracing radically open ideas and connecting various expertise and knowledge. Teaching can be a form of artistic and creative practice in collaboration with a diverse community. Teachers can invent new forms of learning spaces such as Artist-run schools, Hackerspaces and Museums.  

Learning objective: In this class, students will learn about applying artistic processes to teaching. Students will read about the history of artists in and out of academic institutions, Black Mountain College as well as more recent experiments. Students are expected to engage in a critical discussion about the topic.  

Learning outcome: Students will become knowledgeable about various ways of teaching. Students will create a lesson plan for a workshop.

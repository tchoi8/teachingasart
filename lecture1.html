## Teaching ≠ Education 

...Discipline changes animal nature into human nature. ...But man needs a reson of his own.... 

...Man needs nurture and culture. Culture includes discipline and *instruction*. 

...education must also supply a person with *discretion*, so that he may be able to conduct himself in society.

– Education, Immanuel Kant, 1803

## Learning to learn
 
 In learning an action, instead of having it given ready-made, one of necessity learns to vary its factors, to make varied combinations of them, according to change of circumstances. A possibility of continuing progress is opened up by the fact that in learning one act, methods are developed good for use in other situations. Still more important is the fact that the human being acquires a habit of learning. He learns to learn.

For the lack of invention often found in the handweaving of today is a general symptom of this time of standardization. If teaching attempts to direct the development of individuals as well as of peoples, it should try to avert a growing onesidedness which may prove fatal. For ability to form materials presupposes responsiveness towards the material, a flexibility of reaction, and this flexibility is one of the factors we will need for times to come. Through working with material we can perhaps develop this ability to respond. More than intangible material, than tones or words, tangible material can teach that it has demands of its own and suggestions of its own for its forming, that it asks for a reaction. Creating means this reacting to material rather than the execution of a dream, as the layman conceives it. The first vision of something to be done gives more the mood of the work than its final form. The form emerges as the work progresses.

## Experimenter

 To Fuller, investigational prototyping was inextricably part of any experimental method—“I designed this thing so it would deliberately fall down, would not stand.” As disorderly as the process of constructing the dome may have appeared to participants—wet Venetian blinds scattered throughout the landscape of Black Mountain’s Lake Eden campus—the dome was, according to him, engineered and “measured by comprehensive and strict practices of calculation and test.” Fuller wanted students to think structurally about buildings, questioning underlying engineering principles without accepting formal architectural conventions.

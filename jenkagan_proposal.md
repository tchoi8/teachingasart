### abstract
this is a series of workshops that aims to ground efforts to "do good with tech" in u.s. social movement history. 
in other words, it's a u.s. history class for tech people who want to do work in the public interest. we'll study some of the historical and contemporary pitfalls and opportunities of tech for good.

### primary sources
a guiding principle of this workshop is: we learn what our work is from people who are most impacted. we don't sketch, prototype, or launch purely in order to solve imaginary problems or access venture/foundation funding. rather, our design process should be informed by existing material, technical, and social constraints in communities. since many of us are not currently directly impacted by targeted surveillance, threat of deportation, police violence, etc., one of our primary focuses will be listening to and learning how to seek out primary sources to guide our work.

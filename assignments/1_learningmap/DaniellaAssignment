First encounter with an idea:

At the age of seven my mother sent me a postcard describing a mercury fountain.

It was a sculpture at the museum of Joan Miro in Barcelona and I became obsessed with it. A

fountain of such an interesting material that moves inside a thermometer, but when it breaks

and hits the floor it seems as though a piece of another planet had fallen into your hands!

Throughout my whole childhood I secretly dreamed about it. I imagined the fountain in different

colors and forms; I constantly changed its shape and how could people interact with it.

I visualized it as this majestic, liquid-shimmery structure that had its own light and life.

After many years I had the chance to visit Miro's museum in Barcelona, and I stayed there

looking at the fountain for a long time. I thought about how for all those years the "Art" of it had

resided in my mind. And now that I saw it before me, I had a revelation: the inexplicable

mystery and allure of the element mercury was exactly the way art had become to me.

I didn’t care how the fountain really looked like at that moment, or if it was or not as majestic as I

had imagined. What I mostly cared for was the feeling of contentment and joy it gave me-the

opportunity to dream all those years and create structures of imagination and hope-and most

importantly how this experience can be transmitted to others. For as Louse Bourgeois said,

"When you admire something you become larger than yourself. When you witness beauty, you

begin to have hope again.”

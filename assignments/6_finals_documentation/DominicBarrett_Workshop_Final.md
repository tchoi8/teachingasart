# Curriculum
Introduce different concepts, motivations, and approaches towards making music via the Vaporwave genre and it’s musical precedents.

Use this knowledge while learning the technology to make music and noise with your computer, assuming zero prior knowledge

Discuss theory and practicality of sample based music. Music as object, appropriation, critique.

Learn by doing. Open format jam session/hackathon with option to discuss technical issues and brainstorm ideas.

**Teaching Philosophy:** We learn by doing, but discussion and prompts help us decide what to do. Completing work is inspiring to the artist.

**Learning Objective:** Not only provide technical knowledge to make students comfortable with making sounds and music, but historical knowledge to make students comfortable with the artistic practice of digital sound making.

**Learning Outcome:** Students will start to feel comfortable with the basics of audio manipulation and creation on their computers. A broader understanding of experimental and unorthodox musical expression will be gained, possibly inspiring students in their own practices.

Students will produce work in a very short amount of time, hopefully contributing to a sense of play and practical, plausible, and satisfying DIY ethos. This process is intended to serve as a potential tool in the student's’ practice to address artistic “writers block”.

Plainly, because all of the work is considered strange or unusual by conventional perspective, there is no “wrong” or “right” artistic output. This not only gives technical, but emotional “cover” to the student. This can encourage a free-wheeling exploration of the tools, which aids in technical knowledge. And because strict technical mastery is not required for the “right” output, the student can feel that they have completed works much faster than they may expect. According to my teaching philosophy, the creation of final works aids in comfort and motivation of one’s practice.


# Syllabus
**Curated music history general overview:**

  - Muzak, Musique Concrete, Hip Hop, Plunderphonics, Chop N’ Screw, Vaporwave

**Basic approaches to music production and sound design:**

  - Manipulating audio directly, using Audacity (audio editor)

  - Sequencing/scoring instruments, using LMMS (step sequencer, digital audio workstation)

  - Mixing and designing sound: effects, equalizing, and layering

**Workflow:**
  - managing project files and audio

**Sample hunting:** 
  - where, how, and why


# Feedback

I generally received positive feedback, which feels nice. But I also got some very good ideas about how to make the workshop better; from providing more structured, pre-made technical examples to citing specific difficulty with certain terms.

The motivations of participants going in and further interests coming out differed. Some were more interested in the academic musical analysis of Vaporwave and were interested in going down that path more, while others were eager to look at different genres. Some seemed more excited about simply creating music and sound, with the historical and academic parts set aside.

# Personal Notes
There was “the plan” and then the reality in the room. I had partially expected this, and had accommodated for some flexibility in my lesson plan. But there is a vast difference between thinking about improvising in the abstract versus actually being *in* the moment and knowing you need to do it.

I wound up spending more time on the history than I initially planned, added an extra bathroom break, and totally removed one section of my technical workshop in favor of using more time for free exploration of what we already learned.

This last situation was a point where I asked the room how they were feeling, and if they wanted to go to the LMMS section. Enthusiasm was… low. I had already gone over a lot of technical concepts in the Audacity section. I showed a little preview of what I might go over, and while I think it was good to see that little preview, we all agreed that our time was better spent getting more experience with Audacity.

I also may have overestimated how eager people might be to share their work. There were still concerns about sound pieces being “not ready” to share. While I was able to eventually reach a kind of more freewheeling, casual atmosphere in the class, it was hard fought. I was more optimistic about achieving that state of messy, fast and loose artistic creation than I should have been. It is still something I wish to achieve in the future, but I’ve learned more about the possible hurdles in achieving that social feeling.

*(I'm going to post the final musical pieces soon, but some of the participants haven't decided to share just yet. I will post everything I have by Monday)*

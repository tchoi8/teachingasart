###*Is time travel possible? Can you kill a goat by staring at it? How do our eyes know how to cry when we are sad? Why do humans walk on two legs and dogs on four? How big is space?*

We are most naturally curious when we are children: we ask big bold questions and we point out when we don’t understand. As we grow up our natural curiosity is often tamped down by school and other things we do.

Research shows that comparing to children adults are less likely to seek out help, share and ask questions. I dare to say that it doesn’t have to be so.

I invite you to **Unlearning workshop, where asking big questions is cool.**

The goal of the workshop is to explore the process of asking big questions and looking for answers through a collaborative work.

  **Where?** Room 50, ITP, Tisch School of the Arts (4th floor)

  **When?** 3pm, Thursday, March 16

  **What is the structure of the workshop?** In a spirit of unlearning, the structure will be revealed to those attending upon the beginning of the workshop.

  **Do I have to bring anything?** Just your open mind and desire to collaborate with other people.

  **Do I have to register?** Please, RSVP to ruta@nyu.edu

  **Can I bring friends?** Yes! Everyone is welcome.

The workshop is inspired by School in The Cloud and Sugata Mitra.

Organized by Ruta Kruliauskaite, graduate student at ITP, NYU.

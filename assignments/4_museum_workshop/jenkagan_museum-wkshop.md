## feedback on francesca's workshop
francesca created a hands-on workshop called "como decía mi abuela" to be taught students age 6-10 at the museo del barrio. 

we met in the meeting room at ITP and francesca provided some framing for the activity based on [the curriculum](https://github.com/kaganjd/teachingasart/blob/master/assignments/3_museum_curriculum/Francesca.workshop.md) she'd presented in the previous class:

"Why Folk Art? To me Folk Art it's something that is produced by members of a social or ethnic group in a traditional way, handmade and conceived in a collective way that constitutes an expression of their cultural life. It's about building community, about collective storytelling and about making visible hidden stories.

Here, kids between 6 and 10 years, will explore those stories they’ve learn from their grandparents and design and handcraft objects that they will create where they can store these stories."

she then showed several examples of folk art. one was a small, brightly painted cabinet with lots of small handmade figures inside.

another was a board that people drew visual narratives onto instead of writing texts in words. another was a statue of a cow that related to a story about a drought. and there was an amazing video of a group of people participating in an annual ritual where they build a bridge together from two sides of a canyon. i *loved* these examples! i wish there had been one slide that showed all the examples that stayed up during the entire workshop, for inspiration.

after the examples, we both shared memories we had of our grandparents and thought about what kind of objects we might be able to make to remember their stories. here, i wonder if a little more structure around how to pick out a make-able object from the story would be helpful. what i mean is: i imagine a room full of 8-year-olds rambling about things their grandparents have said. to maintain (some) focus, it could be helpful to have a brief coming together period where students share to the group while the facilitator listens and picks out some of the objects from the student's story. then, everyone could see that one way to decide what to make would be to look for objects in the story.

then, production time! this part was really nice because we could chat and get to know each other better while we made our projects. i learned about francesca's grandfather's schemes to get her to buy them both ice cream without telling francesca's mom.

it was fun to have so many different materials: fabric, glitter, glue, cardboard, scraps of wood, buttons. one possibility for future versions would be to have some pre-made objects that students could decorate if they weren't sure what to build for themselves. or for students who like drawing/painting more than making a thing from scratch. some kind of show-and-tell at the end to wrap things up could also be cool.

i made a thing based on a story i remember about my grandmother always hounding me to brush my hair before leaving the house.

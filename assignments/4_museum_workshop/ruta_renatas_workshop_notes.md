I loved Renata's effort to put up this workshop, I could see how she really loved her visit to The Morgan Library.
Her workshop focused on the works of Emily Dickinson and the main activities were around getting me familiar with it from the inside out.
She introduced me to the basics about EMily Dickinson and her work as well as gave me listened to a few of her poems.
Finally, I got "unfinished" poems and had to finish them using dashes writing technique just as Emily Dickinson would.

**Here's a brief overview:**

### About Emily Dickinson

Renata briefly told me about Emily Dickinson's life again, about her use of dashes when writing and gave me to read a chapter of analysis how her use of dashes could be interpreted.

### Listening to poems

Then we listened to two poems: *The Day Undressed - Herself* and *I Heard A Fly Buzz - When I Died*

### Exercise #1 Dash writing: poem 1

Then Renata gave me first poem in print, only without dashes. We listened to it again and I had to put the dashes wherever I felt they should be.
After she have gave me a full version to see whether I interpreted it the way Emily Dickinson would.

### Exercise #2 Dash writing: poem2

After I looked at a full version of poem 1, I thought I got a better sense about Emily Dickinson's strategies putting dashes and we moved to the second poem.
Here I almost got everything exactly how Emily Dickinson would write it: if there's a sudden pause in the middle of the sentence or long pause at the end, it means there's a dash.

### Exercise #3 -!? writing: poem3
Renata gave me the third poem: *I'm Nobody! Who are you?* There she writes not only dashes, but also exclamation and question marks. It made the task much more complicated. Renata gave me to listen to the poem several times and then I tried to put marks as I listened.

The workshop was really beautiful and lasted for an hour. It made me relax after the stressful day. I loved how much Renata knew about Emily Dickinson and she shared all with me.
Poems is something I don't usually read but taking a very personal approach to them and having ability to "touch" them made an entire experience so unusual.

My drawing for Ari:
![Black American Affluent Grad Student] (http://www.kripchak.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/TAA_AriWorkshop.jpg)

Ari gave me more details about the subject of the drawing as time went on. The comments below were written as I read 1 or 2, reacted, drew, read next 1 or 2, reacted/drew, etc. etc. 

The numbered blocks are the prompts as I was given them.
"---" indicates my reactions.

1.) She’s a young Black American. She’s grown up in the Washington, D.C. Area.
--- Thought about drawing my cousin (light-skinned) or Daphne (dark-skinned, athletic, hottest and most beautiful black woman I've ever met).

2.) From appearance, she has darker brown skin, very curvaceous, a big afro and usually wears big hoops. To someone looking at her for the first time - she could easily fit many Black stereotypes.
--- "Very curvaceous" was a challenge because the "very" made me question whether to lean toward over-weight or not (ie. Beyonce vs. Aretha Franklin).

3.) If you hear her speak, you’ll recognize that she’s been well educated.

4.) She spends a majority of her paychecks to go to concerts and clothes to wear at these concerts.
--- I wanted to show at least concert memorabilia or her going to one of the concerts. Not sure what show...

5.)She’s a grad student at Howard University - a Historically Black College/University in D.C.

6.) In high school, she attended a science and technology magnet program.
She’s studying psychology/counseling in secondary education. She spends her days in the classroom working with students of extreme needs that have incredibly toxic living circumstances.
--- The high school history is what brought in the glasses.

7.) Growing up, she lived in an area that was very suburban while also just streets from questionable areas that held a lot of crime.

8.) She lives with her family in the most affluent African-American county in the world - her family’s house (they moved there about 4 years ago) would sell for close from 750k to 1 Million dollars.

9.) Though her house is beautiful and big, it currently holds a lot of struggle.

10.) Her grandma moved in to their home about a month ago after showing unstable conditions within her Alzheimer’s disease. Her family is being truly tested with patience while dealing with their grandma’s conditions. Her parents, that used to rarely ever fight, are fighting more common than not. Everyone is dealing with this experience in different ways but the people in her family are all suffering. Her dad’s blood pressure is dangerously high.
--- Liked the details about home life. Scouring them to find a way to put them in the drawing, it led to asking how these issues would affect her physical appearance.
--- The "normalness" of the household issues helped me relate to her. So even though I don't think I found a way to visually represent them, I think they greatly contributed to the goal of the workshop.

11.) She is one of the kindest and most giving person you’ll ever meet. She puts other’s needs before her own, always.

12.) She’s growing up as a young, dark complexion Black women in a country that glamorizes and celebrates women of fairer skin. She’s growing up Black in a country to punishes and oppresses people that look like her, because of the way that they look. Her upbringing is an outlier in the Black community, and she realizes that and is working to fight that.
--- I guess I just don't know how to react/process the "punishes and oppresses" paragraph, really would want to have a conversation cause I felt the same way during your talk, Ari.
---I'm not sure I understand "upbringing an outlier, fighting to change that." Does this mean, working to help increase number of affluent/middle class black families? I took it to mean this and, along with the "oppressive" section, I added the "peace necklace" and the "LOVE" belt.

Final Comments/Explanations:
---I guess the flowers and the 1950s glasses came from the suburban influence. Her flamboyant attire and accessories demo the fact that she has always, naturally expressed her unique identity. I wanted to give her a concert shirt, and decided to go with Taylor Swift. The "suburbia" section later solidified that.

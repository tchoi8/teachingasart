We were ants, going through a maze looking for a place to explore.
Finally we found a spot. A cold but familiar enviornment. 
We went back to being human. Mithru opened his computer and showed me lines, grids, patters, numbers - - -> I only saw beauty (Therefore I was amazed.)
Normally, my instinct or mathfobia would torment my possibilities of paying attention or uderstanding, however I had a smile in my face because I realized that aftert our previous conversations and attempts at knowing each other, 
Mithru made a connection. He found a way to catch my attention by opening up a space of familiar magic: the work of Sol Lewitt.
Together we went step by step through Sol Lewitts wall art and then Mithru tried to explain to me how I could recreate this work in p5 by using simple math.
The crucial moment of this workshop, for me,  occured when I asked Mithru to help me visualize this concepts of math that he was talking about.
I wanted to understand his dialogue within code and visualize it. 
It was crucial because he understood exactly what I needed and we began a process of revealing the invisible connections in space via
beauty and math. 
Thank you Mithru!

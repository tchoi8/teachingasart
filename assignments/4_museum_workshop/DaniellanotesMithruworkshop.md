We were ants, going through a maze looking for a place to explore.
Finally we found a spot. A cold but familiar enviornment. 
We went back to being human. Mithru opened his computer and showed me lines, grids, patterns, numbers - - -> I only saw beauty (Therefore I was amazed.)
Normally, my instinct or mathfobia would torment my possibilities of paying attention or uderstanding, however I had a smile in my face because I realized that after our previous conversations and attempts at knowing each other, 
Mithru made a connection. He found a way to catch my attention by opening up a space of familiar magic: the work of Sol Lewitt.
Together we went step by step through Sol Lewitt's wall drawings and then Mithru tried to explain to me how I could recreate this work in p5 code by using simple math.
The crucial moment of this workshop, for me,  occured when I asked Mithru to help me visualize the mathematical concepts that he was trying to explain in relation to Lewitt's work. 
I wanted to understand his dialogue within the code and create my own map, my own mental sketch.  
It was crucial because he understood exactly what I needed and we began a process of revealing the invisible connections in space via
beauty and math. 
Thank you Mithru!

I believe my biggest takeaway from this workshop is precisely finding the connection between learning and human emotions. 
Mithru gave me one thing that I truly needed: the space to slow down and digest the information in an interesting and aesthetic manner. I desperately need to learn how to code, and I am always looking for ways to understand the mathematical aspects of this. 
I would have appreciated a bigger screen to interact with, a tactile aspect or an environment.
For me the code element was essential because it allows you to compare and understand structures and ultimately reality.
For the next iteration of this workshop, it could be interesting to combine actual drawing in the wall with a ruler and pencil, doing this just as Sol Lewitt did, and using a projector to trace the lines in the wall that you are doing with code. Maybe it could be an opportunity to expand and talk a bit more about the concept behind Sol Lewitt's drawings. His writings and very interesting ideas, maybe for a coder -not an artist- knowing more about the art part could be interesting and engaging. Push the comfort zone.

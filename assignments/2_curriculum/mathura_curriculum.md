##A little prequel

Sophomore year in India (10th standard) is the year before higher secondary or pre-college education. This means that at the end of this year students are expected to make their first career choice. 

Post this year, students pick a particular education track that to a large extent decides their career track. For instance, in my school, on completion of sophomore year we had to choose between PCMB ( Physics, Chemistry, Math, Biology ), PCMC (Physics, Chemistry, Math, Computer Science) and Commerce (Mathematics, Economics, Business Studies,  Accountancy).

At the end of this year we also write an exam that ~1 million students in the country take together.

I tried to consider these points while putting down my ideal curriculum.

##Sophomore year curriculum

###School Philosophy

Education is not a mere act of learning facts. It is about the process of learning, understanding, and more importantly, an art that teaches one how to learn.
At this school, this is the core message that we like to pass on to our students in their sophomore year. As we prepare them to step out of these protective walls, we want to ensure they step out as strong, independent individuals, individuals who have had enough exposure to understand the choices they have before them and pick an option with due diligence. We also strive to establish a learning environment where collaboration is key to success.

###Process of Education 

During this crucial time of school education, our teachers play the roles of guides and mentors. Students will be given a chance to explore various industries with help of professionals in the fields in practical and fun ways. We believe it to be important that students are given maximum exposure to the possibilities that await them. We take it on ourselves to filter down the vast amount of information available today and provide to the students information that is pertinent in the given scenario.

In this process, students and teachers together have one important task to fulfill and that is to ensure that the students learn how to learn. We understand that it is not possible to cover everything we wish for our students to know within the classrooms. We also realize that it is possible to teach them the tools to learn everything. With this in mind, our curriculum focuses on letting our students dig deeper in subjects of their choice. This will be done along with substantial practical training in an industry of their selection with teacher guidance.

###Philosophy for subject content

The subjects taught in sophomore year will provide the students with core understanding in the following subjects
- Mathematics 
- Sciences ( Physics, Chemistry, Biology )
- English Literature
- An additional language of the students choice
- Social Studies (History, Geography)
In addition to theory and laboratory classes, all of the above will be taught in conjunction with the arts. To practically understand the implication and intersection of every subject and not view them as separate and unrelated concepts, students and teachers will experiment together mixing the arts and sciences.
Students will spend a few hours a week working in small groups on investigative projects of their choice. 

###The ultimate goal

We believe this year to be crucial for not only our students but also our teachers. We wish to shape our students into strong-willed and principled adults who understand the power of choices and responsibilities. We wish for our teachers to learn more about the students' goals and together model a system that works best for the unique individuals they are.

##Brief
In China, Sophomore year in high school is when you finish the basics of the high school and try to pass the Joint Graduation Examination (HuiKao). After the student has passed the Joint Graduation Examination, students will be qualified to graduate from high school and get to choose either science (Li Ke, which includes physics, chemistry and biology) or liberal arts (Wen Ke, which includes History, politics and geology) along with three universal subjects - Chinese, Math and English for their college preference. Additionally, for those who are interested in Arts, they will also need to study paintings. Therefore, students would choose what they are interested in, and focus on certain subjects and prepare for the national college entrance examination during the junior year of high school (note that there are only three years in Chinese High school).
There are also another portion of the students who are interested in studying overseas, they may choose to unfollow the traditional Chinese high school system either after they have passed the Joint Graduation Examination or before taking the college entrance examination. Students can soon started studying and preparing for SAT, ACT, AP, TOEFL and etc, and applying overseas colleges.
Since options for students are diverse, and most of the schools are only aiming for selected outcomes, I would like to try to make an universal curriculum that can help students to be aware of all the possibilities.

##Concept
To be practical, students expect to enter higher education after graduating high school, but this curriculum is not only designed for an outcome of a success bachelor level school admission but also for the purpose of cultivating better talents. As there is a variety of schools, either domestic or overseas, either universities or field specific colleges, this curriculum is applicable in many students.

##Features
By adding Fine arts and computer foundation to the general studies, students are able to expose to some basic knowledge of creative, critical and logical thinking, which I believe are good for their future use in many different fields. The subject Chinese as Chinese literature is also something I would like to emphasize, especially I would add more modern literature, which can deliver students some basic understanding of the modern China and the progression of culture, politics and ideology over the century, which I believe these can help students to know how we came to where we are as Chinese and where are now and what is better for the future.

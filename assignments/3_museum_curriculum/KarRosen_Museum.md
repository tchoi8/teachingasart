My museum of choice is the Metropolitan Museum of Art. I attended in person but wasn’t able to go to one of the educational events in the museum but they have plenty of listing online. They have a wide variety of options for all ages. Interactive activity days for children, as well as audio tours meant for children, as well as adults for self-guided tours. They have workshop for K-12 educators, and one can even request a topic as well. That being said, the site doesn’t list topics they cover, just only the current one being held. The current topic is mixing art with social studies and humanities. Upon further diffing they have a Sunday Studio event where children and adults make art at the museum. 

For teens they don’t show much about educational workshops, but they have this social gathering event with music and food, which seems more like a concert or party, which I think is cool regardless. Other than that, the Met highlights their high school internship program, of which I was not aware such internships exist. I am kind of jealous because I would have loved something like that in high school! For university students, they also offer internships and fellowships. One cool thing is they Met College Group, which organizes group events for fellow college student, which are themes tours and such. Some of them seem to have music and interactive activities as well! They also have one program called “The Observant Eye”, which focuses on one piece of work in the museum and they have an hour long examination and discussion about it. 

For adults it is the group or self-guided tours, with a guide or through audio.

Adults also have access to gallery talks with curators and conservators as well. They also have creative workshops for adults and teens too. Currently they are holding on printmaking and a drop in drawing event s where an artist can join at any time and study and sketch a piece of work in the museum. Another thing is on Friday evenings the Met from six to nine in the evening have the following events available, anything from concerts to gallery talks to guided themed tours. 
What I find interesting is they have some accommodations for accessibility, Tours for the deaf; some gloved tactile tours for the blind and visually impaired, and even have special tours for people on the autism spectrum or adults with dementia.  What I enjoy most about it isn’t even about the educational programs, but rather the resources they have online for people on the spectrum for their visits. Cards to hand to security and guides in case they do not wish or are unable to speak, a checklist of what you need to visit, sensory friendly maps and printable guide to plan and map out your trip before going to ease overload. 

Needless to say the Met has so many programs and events for all ages and is very well rounded in that area.

***Female Figues in Art History***

**Audience:** Students in Highschool to Graduate School, teens and adults who have an interest in Art History and Feminism

**Workshop content:**  We will once again revisit the history of art, highlighting artworks depicting women made by women on display at the museum. We will learn the lives and stories behind the artist and the painting, and discuss. A creative activity will follow.

**Prompts to Ask the Audience:**

* *What do you see in the painting?*
* *What do you relate to you? /What resounds with you the most?*
* *Are there any parallels to modern artists that you might see?*

**Creative Activity:** *A Day In The Life:* Students assume the role of painter themselves or either one of the artists contemporary or themselves as a person living in the time of the painter. Write a small piece about the piece shown: it can be a diary entry, newspaper article or review of the piece. (Or for those who might want to paint, to paint their own piece inspired by one of the women mentioned in the workshop.)

**Learning objectives:** Students gain a more well-rounded knowledge of art history, and more mindfulness to sexism in the arts.

**Meetup:** Group event/tour at Metropolitan Museum of Art

**Time:** Approximately 2-3 Hours
* Tour and Discussion: 1 Hour
* Break (continuation of discussions optional but encouraged!): 15 Minutes
* Creative Activity: 1 hour
